# CS_350_final_project

The purpose of this application was create a themrostat using a TI CC3220 launchpad. This was my first time creating a task scheduler in a project and I think I did a good job achieving all the desired functionality. One thing I couldve done better with this project was adding more comments to my code so it's easier to decipher what each method does and which peripherals I used within the project. A lot of the skills I learned not only for this project but in this course overrall has made me very interested in working with embedded systems in the future and I think I will try and create more projects in my free time.
